# vehicular-channel-estimation-dl
A deep learning framework to enhance channel estimation for low-delay and high-reliability vehicular communications (V2X), enabling smarter transportation systems.

This project presents a deep learning (DL)-powered framework for **enhancing channel estimation** in **vehicular communication networks (V2X)**. The goal is to achieve more **reliable**, **accurate**, and **low-latency** wireless communications between vehicles and infrastructure â€” essential for intelligent transport systems (ITS) and autonomous driving.
